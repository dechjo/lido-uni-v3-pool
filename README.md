# Lido stETH pool for Uniswap V3

This codebase, derived from the [uniswap-liquidity-dao](https://github.com/dmihal/uniswap-liquidity-dao) code, creates a pool for wstETH & ETH tokens, depositted into Uniswap V3. Liquidity is depositted 80% into the 0.95-1.01 range, and 20% to the 0.90-1.03 range. Liquidity positions are represented as fungible ERC-20 tokens, similar to Uniswap V2 positions.
